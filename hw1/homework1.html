<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>In this experiment, I build up a rasterization pipeline to present the svg or png files in the screen space. I implement function <b><i>
rasterize_triangle </i></b>to directly show the svg files, some transform functions like <b><i>translate, scale and rotate</i></b> to help transform the 
graphs in the svg files, function <b><i>rasterize_interpolated_color_triangle</i></b> to calculate barycentric coordinates and use them to interpolate 
vertex colors across the triangle, function <b><i>rasterize_textured_triangle</i></b> to put the texture(image) onto the shape that we want. The shape 
is decided in the svg files by using uv coordinates. What's more, to solve antialiasing problem caused by the limited screen resolution, I implement 
<b>pixel sampling</b> to decide what color to fill in the screen pixels according to the uv coordinates and texture, <b> level sampling</b> to 
decide which mipmap level we use for the pixel, <b>supersampling </b> to smooth the image by averaging the color values and remove the high-frequency 
details as well as jaggies. With this pipeline we can turn every svg file into smooth image!
</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>

<p><b>How to resterize triangles: </b>Firstly, Instead of checking every pixel in the frame_buffer, we can just check the pixels within the 
bounding box of the triangle. Specifically, it is the rectangle with corners at (min_x, min_y), (min_x, max_y), (max_x, min_y), (max_x, max_y), 
aligned with the coordinate axes for simplicity. Then we cross product the coordinate vector of a point with the direction vectors of 
lines of the triangle one by one. If all three of the value have the same sign, the point is inside the triangle.</p>
<br>

<p>Here is a <b><i>png</i></b> screenshot of <b><i>basic/test4.svg</i></b> with the pixel inspector centered on jaggies of the triangles' edges.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>
<p><b>Why is supersampling useful? </b>Aliasing occurs when high-frequency details in a picture are under-sampled, leading to jaggies.
  What supersampling does is like filtering the image to smooth it and remove the high-frequency information inside the image by averaging 
  the pixel values. So when high-frequency details are removed, jaggies are removed at the same time. Successfully achieved antialiasing!
</p>

<p><b>Motification I did: </b>1. Change the size of the sample_buffer to width * height * sample_rate, which is sample_rate times bigger.<br>
  2. Change function <b><i>rasterize_triangle: </i></b>imagine now we have sample_rate times more samples inside each triangle that we have to 
  rasterize, to check whether they are in the triangle or not, I traverse the bounding box of the triangle with a step size of 1/sample_rate 
  pixel, instead of 1 pixel. And if the point is inside the triangle, I fill the corresponding point in the sample buffer with corresponding color.<br>
  3. Since in function <b><i>rasterize_triangle</i></b> I choose to directly assign the color value to the sample_buffer without using 
  function <b><i>fill_pixel</i></b>, now I have to change this <b><i>fill_pixel</i></b> function so that it can fit for function <b><i>rasterize_point </i></b>
  and function <b><i>rasterize_line</i></b> since there are boundaries and outlines in some of the pictures which are drawn by lines rather than 
  triangles. To be specific, as we enlarge the size of the sample_buffer, we have to fill more points in it for original single points and 
  lines so that they can stay the same shape as it was before supersampling.<br>
  4. After finishing rasterizing all the points and lines and triangles, which means the sample_buffer now has all the information we need 
  to build up the image in our screen space, we can now assign color values to the frame_buffer by using function <b><i>resolve_to_framebuffer.</i></b> 
  Count how many subpixels are there in one pixel and then assign the average color value to the corresponding point in the frame_buffer. 
  We are done with our supersampling!

  <figcaption aligh="middle">As for sample rate 1, the corner of the triangle is too sharp for the screen to catch its details. So these
    jaggies things come out and the image appears discontinuous. But with the increase of the sample_rate, supersampling helps us to blur
    the original image as well as remove the high-frequency details. So jaggies are gone and the whole image (especially for the red and 
    pink triangle)looks much smoother.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>
<p><b>Barycentric coordinates</b> is a way to describe the location of a point in relation to the triangle's 3 vertices. The distances 
  from 3 vertices to the point can be thought of as influencing the point within the triangle, where the point's position is determined 
  by how much it is "pulled" towards each vertex by the distance.

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>
<p><b>pixel sampling</b> is a way to determine the color values of pixels when rendering images or texture. <b>Texture mapping </b> is the
  process of applying a texture (an image or pattern) onto the surface of a geometric shape (or screen space) to give it more details.
  The problems are that the texture only has discrete pixels with rgb colors and the sizes of the texture and the surface are not the same.
  so it's hard to match every pixel on the surface with a texture pixel that we already have. To solve this problem, we transfer the points 
  of both the surface and the texture into uv coordinates. Now we can apply the texture to the surface like what we did in the previous 
  tasks: rasterizing a triangle, check if certain pixel is inside the triangle, use Barycentric coordinates to get the uv coordinates of 
  that certain pixel according to the uv coordinates of the vertices, using pixel sampling method to find the color of that pixel in surface
  according to the color of the point in the texture with the same uv coordinates. 
</p>

<p>We have learned 2 different pixel sampling methods: <b> nearest_sampling</b> chooses one original discrete pixel from the texture that 
  has the closest distance from the pixel we want and gives its color to that pixel. <b>bilinear_sampling</b> chooses four nearest original
  discrete pixels from the texture in the uv coordinates and gives their average value of color to the pixel we want.

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>
<p><b>Level sampling</b> is a technique used to select the appropriate level of detail for a texture based on its appearance in the 
  rendered scene. In other word, we have to use different resolutions of a texture depending on how it's viewed in the scene. To 
  implement it in texture mapping, we have <b>mipmap</b>: a precomputed sequence of textures, each level being a downscaled version 
  of the original texture. Then we can use our level sampling method to decide which mipmap level we will use.
</p>

<p>We have implemented 3 level sampling methods: <b>Zero sampling</b> always chooses level 0. <b>nearest_sampling</b> chooses the nearest
  value of log2(L) as its level. The way we calculate L is that we first calculate the uv coordinates of the certain pixel and its adjacent
  pixel, then we calculate the distance of the two points in uv coordinates and convert the distance to xy coordinates by multiplying it
  with width or height of the texture. <b>Linear_sampling </b>chooses 2 nearest levels and then compute a weighted sum of using one sample 
  from each of the adjacent mipmap levels.
</p>

<b>tradeoffs between pixel sampling, level sampling and supersampling:</b><br><br>
<b>pixel sampling:</b><br>
<p><b>speed: </b>Quite fast as it only involves sampling each pixel once from the texture. And nearest_sampling is faster than Linear_sampling
  since it requires less add and multiplication.<br>
  <b>memory usage: </b>Moderate as it only requires the original texture data. <br>
  <b>antialiasing power: </b>Limited as it actually just samples the texture once per pixel. So it has no effect on solving antialising <br>
</p>

<b>level sampling:</b>
<p><b>speed: </b>Fast since it improves rendering speed when textures are minified. <br>
  <b>memory usage: </b>Higher compared to pixel sampling since it has to stor emultiple levels of the texture, each at a reduced 
  resolution. The increase of the memory usage is approximately 33%(1/3). <br>
  <b>antialiasing power: </b>Improved since it uses different texture levels to smooth out some details that may cause alising. <br>
</p>
<b>supersampling:</b>
<p><b>speed: </b>Significantly slower as it requires sampling each pixel several times and then averaging the results to produce the 
  final pixel colors. <br>
  <b>memory usage: </b>A lot higher especially for sample buffer as it requires storing multiple samples for each pixel during rendering. <br>
  <b>antialiasing power: </b>Very good as it can capture more details in the image and average it out. It's like filtering the image. <br>
