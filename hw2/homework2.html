<p>
    In part 1, we focus on building Bezier curve by de Casteljau's algorithm with a set of control points. In part 2, we recursively use 
    the de Casteljau's algorithm in two directions u, v to construct the Bezier surface given a nxn grid of original control points. Then 
    we focus on halfedge mesh data structure to build up our mesh and implement many functions to operate the mesh elements. As for part 3, 
    we calculate the area-weighted vertex normals for phong shading which provides better shading for smooth surfaces. Then in part 4 and 5 
    we implement 2 important fundamental operations: edge flip and edge split to change the local mesh. Finally, we implement loop subdivision 
    to "up-sample" the global mesh. In short, part 1 and 2 focus on Bezier curves and surfaces used to model smooth, and the rest parts try to 
    represent surfaces using triangle meshes by halfedge data structure.

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier Curves with 1D de Casteljau Subdivision</h3>


<b>
  Briefly explain de Casteljau's algorithm and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier curves.
</b>
<p>
    Suppose there is a set of control points <b>P0, P1, ..., Pn</b> for the Bezier curve of degree n. For each pair of adjacent control points, 
    de Casteljau's algorithm recursively interpolates between these pairs. Every time it will interpolate a new set of points that are 
    proportionally <b>t </b>along the segments connecting the control points, where t ranges from 0 to 1 and is given before interpolation. 
    This results in a new set of <b>n</b> points. Repeat the steps above with the new set of points until only one point is left. By giving a series 
    of different <b>t </b>to repeat the whole process, we can obtain a series of points on the Bezier curve determined by the control points. 
    Finally we can draw the Bezier curve we want according to these points. 
</p>

<b>
  Take a look at the provided .bzc files and create your own Bezier curve with 6 control points of your choosing. Use this Bezier curve for your screenshots below.

<b>
  Briefly explain how de Casteljau algorithm extends to Bezier surfaces and how you implemented it in order to evaluate Bezier surfaces.
</b>
<p>
    This time, instead of having only one set of control points, now we have nxn grid of original control points. Each row of n points <b>Pi0, Pi1,..., Pin</b>
    define a Bezier curve parameterized by <b>u</b>, just as the Bezier curve in part 1 which is parameterized by <b>t</b>. So we can follow the instructions 
    in part 1 to recursively implement de Casteljau algorithm for each row to evaluate the final, single point Pi on this Bezier curve at the parameter u. 
    Then <b>Pi</b> for all n rows define a Bezier curve parameterized by <b>v</b>. We again use the recursive de Casteljau algorithm implemented in part 1 
    to evaluate the single, final point <b>P</b>. This point <b>P</b>, in fact, lies on the Bezier surface at the given <b>u and v</b>. It's like in part 1 we use 
    a set of n control points and t to determine the certain point on the Bezier curve. And in part 2, we use a set of n Bezier curves and <b>v</b> 
    to determine the curve on Bezier surface, where every curve is determined by a set of n control points and <b>u</b>>.

<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the area-weighted vertex normals.
</b>
<p>
    Firstly, we traverse each halfedge connected to this vertex to obtain the normal vector of the face corresponding to this halfedge. Then 
    we calculate the area of the triangle by computing the cross product of two edges of the triangle. By multiplying the normal vector of each 
    triangle by its area, and then summing them all up and taking the average, we obtain our area-weighted vertex normals.

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Edge Flip</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge flip operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    Edge flip operation allows us to rotate the edge shared by two adjacent triangles 90 degree clockwise by replacing the original vertices 
    of the edge with two other vertices of the two triangles. Since this operation doesn't add or delete any mesh elements, we can simply 
    reassign the corresponding vertices, edges, faces to every halfedge data structure, as well as the corresponding halfedge for every vertex, 
    edge and face, to implement this operation. <br>
    
    In order to clearly understand the corresponding relationship between each mesh elements before and after flipping, I draw a picture to 
    to show every mesh elements in the two triangles before and after flipping to help me visualize. It works so well that my code succeeds on 
    the first try.

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: Edge Split</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the edge split operation and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    Edge split operation inserts a new vertex at the middle of the chosen edge, which is shared by two adjacent triangles, and connects the 
    new vertex to the original vertices one by one. This operation not only changes the corresponding relationship between each mesh elements, 
    but also creates 1 new vertex, 3 new edges and 2 new faces. Both the old and new mesh elements need to be reassigned to new values.<br> 
    
    Same as part 4, I draw a picture to help me visualize and understand the corresponding relationship between each mesh elements before and 
    after splitting. Now we have 5 vertices, 8 edges, 4 faces and 12 halfedge that need to be reassigned.

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop Subdivision for Mesh Upsampling</h3>
<b>
  Briefly explain how you implemented the loop subdivision and describe any interesting implementation / debugging tricks you have used.
</b>
<p>
    Following the suggested work flow, I divide my loop subdivision operation into 5 steps. <b>Firstly</b> we compute new positions for all the 
    old vertices and store them in vertex's newPosition variable. <b>Then</b> we compute the positions of new vertices created by edge splitting and store 
    them in the edge's newPosition variable. <b>In step 3</b> we split every edge in the mesh and set the newly-created edges' flag isNew. <b>Next</b> we 
    flip any new edge that connects an old and new vertex. <b>Finally</b> we copy each vertex's newPosition into its position. <br><br>

    As for the debugging tricks, the first time I ran my code, my whole computer got stuck and crashed. To figure out the bugs in the code, 
    I firstly commented out step 4 and 5 to see if it works. Unfortunately the program still got stuck. So I commented out step 3 as well and 
    this time the program didn't get stuck though nothing really happened. So I guess there must be something wrong with the loop in step 3 
    when splitting edges. In order to avoid infinite loop, I call mesh.nEdges to get the number of edges before splitting edges. Then I change 
    the for loop to add i from 0 to n and do edge splitting during each loop so that only exactly n original edges will be splitted. 
</p>
<br>


<b>
  Take some notes, as well as some screenshots, of your observations on how meshes behave after loop subdivision. What happens to sharp corners and edges? Can you reduce this effect by pre-splitting some edges?
</b>
<p>
    After loop subdivision, the behavior of meshes is to gradually converge to a smooth approximation of the original mesh. Sharp corners 
    and edges become more rounded and smooth after subdivision because the newly added vertices are weighted averages of the positions of 
    surrounding vertices. This weighted averaging shifts vertices away from their original sharp edge positions, thereby reducing sharpness.<br>
    
    After observing images that have undergone loop subdivision, I believe that pre-splitting existing edges cannot reduce the smoothing effect. 
    This is because I noticed that those sharp angles seem to have a degree less than 6. Since most vertices have a degree of 6, the overall plane 
    tends to be smooth after loop subdivision. Splitting operations can only increase the degree of vertices, and vertices with a degree greater 
    than 6 will have an inward denting rather than a protruding visual effect after loop subdivision, therefore, it cannot achieve the purpose of 
    reducing the smoothing effect.

    As mentioned in last question, the vertex having a degree less than 6 looks sharp and the degree more than 6 has an inward denting. 
    So to subdivide the cube symmetrically, we can use flip and split operations to make sure than almost every edge has a degree of 6.
