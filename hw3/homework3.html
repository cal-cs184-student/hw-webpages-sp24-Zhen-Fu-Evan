<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>
    In this homework, we implement several methods used widely in path tracing to render highly realistic images by simulating the physical 
    processes of light interactions with objects in the scene. In part 1 we implement <i>Camera::generate_ray </i>and <i>PathTracer::raytrace_pixel </i>
    to generate ray. And we also implement functions to detect whether a ray intersects with primitives in the scene. Then in part 2 we construct 
    our BVH structure to accelerate the speed at which we determine whether a ray intersects with an object. In part 3 we start simulating 
    direct light transport in the scene. In order to do so, we implement zero-bounce radiance and two ways of calculating one-bounce radiance: 
    one is<b>estimate_direct_lighting_hemisphere, </b>which we estimate the direct lighting on a point by sampling uniformly in a hemisphere. 
    And the other is<b>estimate_direct_lighting_importance</b>, which we sample all the lights directly by importance sampling. In part 4 
    we implement <b>at_least_one_bounce_radiance</b> to add indirect lightings to our scene. The number of times a ray bounces depends on 
    both the set max_ray_depth and Russian Roulette. Finally, to avoid large amount of noise without increasing the number of samples per pixel, 
    we implement adaptive sampling in part 5 so that when a pixel has converged we stop tracing more rays for this pixel.

<h2 align="middle">Part 1: Ray Generation and Scene Intersection (20 Points)</h2>
<!-- Walk through the ray generation and primitive intersection parts of the rendering pipeline.

<h3>
  Walk through the ray generation and primitive intersection parts of the rendering pipeline.
</h3>
<p>
    <b>Ray generation: </b>We firstly implement <i>Camera::generate_ray </i>function to generate a ray starting from the camera position 
    and pointing towards the given point (x,y). Since the direction we calculated is based on camera coordinates we have to multiply it 
    with the camera-to-world matrix to transform it back to the world coordinate. Then we implement <i>PathTracer::raytrace_pixel </i>to estimate the integral of 
    radiance over a pixel. Specifically, we randomly generate num_samples camera rays towards the given pixel by sampling and then call 
    <i>est_radiance_global_illumination </i>to estimate the scene radiance along each ray and then incorporate it into the Monte Carlo 
    estimate to get the final radiance. <br><br>
    <b>Primitive intersection: </b>After rays are generated, we need to intersect with primitives in the scene to determine what is visible 
    and how light interacts with surfaces. Generally, we solve the ray equation together with the primitive's surface equation to get the 
    value of <i>t</i>. If it lies within the <i>min_t </i>and <i>max_t </i>of the ray, it means that ray intersects with this primitive and we 
    should update the <i>max_t</i> of the ray accordingly so that all future intersections that are farther away can be promptly ignored.
<br>

<h3>
  Explain the triangle intersection algorithm you implemented in your own words.
</h3>
<p>
  For ray-triangle intersection, we use MÃ¶ller-Trumbore algorithm to calculate the parameter <i>t </i>and 
  the barycentric coordinate of the hit_point according to the triangle. Only if the <i>t</i> we calculate lies within the <i>min_t </i>
  and <i>max_t </i>of the input ray and the hit_point is inside the triangle can we conclude that the ray and the triangle intersects, and we 
  should update the <i>max_t</i> of the ray accordingly so that all future intersections that are farther away can be promptly ignored.

<h3>

</h3>
<p>
    We implement our <i>BVHAccel::construct_bvh </i>to recursively construct a bounding box hierarchy following these steps:<br>
    <li>Compute the bounding box of the current node(The root node encompasses all primitives)</li>
    <li>If the number of primitives at this node is less than or equal to <b>max_leaf_size</b>, the node becomes leaf node and we return.</li>
    <li>If there are more primitives, we calculate the extent of the bounding box and choose the axis along which to split based on the axis with 
      the maximum extent.</li>
    <li>We then calculate the midpoint along this axis and partition the primitives into two groups based on whether their centroid of this axis 
      is less than or greater than this midpoint.</li>
    <li>In case all primitives end up on one side of the partition, we split the list of primitives into two equal halves to avoid infinite recursion.</li>
    <li>Finally, we recursively call <b>construct_bvh</b> for the left and right subsets of primitives and assign the returned nodes to the left and right 
      children of the current node.</li>

<h3>

<p>
    When rendering <i>cow.dae</i> with 5856 primitives, it takes only 1.85s with BVH acceleration, comparing to 70.40s without BVH acceleration. 
    Similarly to <i>maxplanck.dae</i> with 50801 primitives, it takes 1.53s with BVH acceleration comparing to 686s without BVH acceleration. 
    Note that all the pictures were rendered using 8 threads in size of 480x360. So it is obvious that the BVH structure can reduce the rendering 
    time significantly, taking ray intersection complexity from O(n) to O(log(n)).

<p>
    <b>estimate_direct_lighting_hemisphere:</b> For this method, we want to estimate how much light directly arrives on a point by uniformly 
    sample incoming ray directions in the hemisphere. Specifically, if a new ray going from the hit_p in the sampled direction intersects a 
    light source, we calculate the radiance of the light using rendering equation. We approximate the integral over all the light using a 
    Monte Carlo estimator. So by sampling rays in all hemisphere directions we can get the estimated value of the one-bounce radiance. <br><br>
    
    <b>estimate_direct_lighting_importance:</b> This method has the same goal as estimate_direct_lighting_hemisphere, but will sample all 
    the lights directly, rather than uniform directions in a hemisphere. For each light in the scenes, we want to sample directions between 
    the light source and the hit_p. If we cast a ray in this direction and there is no other object between the hit point and the light source, 
    then we know that this light source does cast light onto the hit point, so we use rendering equation to add it to the final result.

<h3>
  Compare the results between uniform hemisphere sampling and lighting sampling in a one-paragraph analysis.
</h3>
<p>
    <b>Uniform hemisphere sampling</b> is simple and unbiased because it involves generating sample rays uniformly across the hemisphere above 
    a point on a surface, ensuring that the entire hemisphere is covered without preference to any direction. However, when encountering 
    scenes with few or distant light sources, as many samples may contribute little to no illumination, the rendered image may look noisy. <br>
    <b>lighting sampling</b>, on the other hand, focuses on sampling rays towards light sources, taking into account their position, shape, 
    and intensity. This method is more efficient than uniform hemisphere sampling because it increases the chances that sampled rays will hit 
    a light source, thereby reducing noise in the rendered image with fewer samples compared to uniform sampling. However, it can introduce bias 
    since it doesn't ensure all potential lighting contributions are considered.

<p>
    In <b>at_least_one_bounce_radiance, </b>we first determine whether the depth of the ray has reached the max_ray_depth. If so, we just return 
    the <b>one_bounce_radiance</b> of the current point. Otherwise, we create a new ray with the sampled direction based on the BSDF at the hit point, 
    trace a ray in that sample direction, and recursively call itself on the new hit point. Each time we call this function, we will calculate 
    the radiance of this bounce based on the rendering equation, and accumulate all former light along the path(if <i>isAccumBounces=true</i>).

    Direct illumination showcases clarity and sharp contrasts of the light, such as bright highlights and sharp shadows. But it also lacks

</h3>
<p>
    Adaptive sampling tries to avoid the problem of using a fixed (high) number of samples per pixel, by concentrating the samples in the 
    more difficult parts of the image. For every <i>samplesPerBatch</i> pixels, we calculate their mean and standard deviation of the 
    illuminance. And then we define a new variable <i>I</i> to measure the pixel's convergence. If it is less than or equal to maxTolerance times 
    the mean, we assume that the pixel has converged and stop tracing more rays for this pixel. If not, we continue the tracing-and-detecting loop.

<h3>
  Pick two scenes and render them with at least 2048 samples per pixel. Show a good sampling rate image with clearly visible differences in sampling rate over various regions and pixels. Include both your sample rate image, which shows your how your adaptive sampling changes depending on which part of the image you are rendering, and your noise-free rendered result. Use 1 sample per light and at least 5 for max ray depth.
